# Amateur-CPP-game-engine

This game engine is written in C++ and uses SDL2 library for 2D/3D rendering. This engine implements its own pool allocator to manage memory in the fastest maner and keep track of all allocation and deallocation processes in order to catch memory leaks. Also for flexible representing game objects the Entity Component System pattern is used.

For Windows users to make the project compilable SDL2 include files must be added to the "include" folder and static library files must be added into the "lib" folder.
